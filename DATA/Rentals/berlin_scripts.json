Finding accommodation can be very difficult since there is a lot of demand for apartments. The population of Berlin is growing faster than its supply of rooms and apartments. Often, the findable accommodation is very small and overpriced. Landlords were able to partly monopolize the housing market, which led to the fact, that they sometimes charge prices which are not payable by students. We, from Housing Anywhere, however, are trying to enable you to break through this obstacle by providing affordable apartments in suitable locations for students from all over the world. Our goal, is to make the process of finding an accommodation as easy as possible so that you don’t have to bother doing that, but rather be able to enjoy your stay in this beautiful city.

Students can simply get a so-called ‘Semesterticket’, a ticket from the university, which can be purchased for a relatively low price and is valid throughout the whole semester. Hence, no top-ups have to be made – once paid, you can use it for 6 months. Also, interns can get a discount, though. This ticket allows one to use any type of public transportation. The most common modes of transportation include the metro, the S-Bahn, the tram, and buses. There are no limitations for you, because the metro, for instance, is running 24\u002F7. Therefore, everything is reachable within a short period of time. However, using a bicycle is also possible since Berlin is becoming more and more bike- and environmentally-friendly. But that is not all: Berlin has one of the main airports in Europe, meaning that you can reach cities like Paris, Rome or Copenhagen within 1-2 hours by plane. It’s the perfect weekend trip for exploring the beauty of Europe.","picture":"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fqr8kennq1pom\u002F04fff17f2bd3\u002Fc28ef96ba988c113b5fb8b0bea1a1e63\u002Fberlin-brandenburger-tor.jpg","pictureAsset":{"id":"04fff17f2bd3","type":"asset","fields":{"title":{"en":"berlin-brandenburger-tor.jpg"},"url":"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fqr8kennq1pom\u002F04fff17f2bd3\u002Fc28ef96ba988c113b5fb8b0bea1a1e63\u002Fberlin-brandenburger-tor.jpg"}},"caption":"24\u002F7 available"},{"title":"Quality of life","description":"Berlin is a very big city with various facets that is definitely worth discovering. In terms of quality of life, it is necessary to mention that the living standard is quite high. However, this does not imply spending a lot of money. It simply means, that whatever it is that you are passionate about, you can definitely follow up on it when coming to Berlin. No matter if you are a techno-lover, an opera fanatic, an artist, an athlete or someone who loves history. There will definitely be a scene that you would like to discover. There are no limits regarding the way you want to live. Prices for rent can range from cheap to expensive. However, by the time you arrive in Berlin, you are required to take out healthcare insurance, which will be covering costs for the doctor or suchlike. The city is focusing on ensuring that everyone, especially the new generation, is able to live up to a certain living standard. There are several universities, like the HU Berlin or the Freie Universität Berlin, offering any type of study program with campuses spread all over the city. Apart from that, public transport can take you anywhere you want, and student discounts can be obtained on almost anything, which can get you cheaper tickets for parties, museums, theatres, concerts or sport events. It is highly recommended to join a club for either sports, arts, music or other things, since it helps with finding friends and getting integrated into the German culture.","caption":"Berlin offers everything you could even possibly need"},{"title":"Berlin’s startup culture","description":"Berlin, Germany’s capital, is about to become Europe’s leading startup scene. Within the next few years, it is expected to generate around 100,000 new jobs. Meaning that the city is growing and therefore a paradise for innovative people who want to make their dreams come true. The development shows that Berlin is a welcoming culture for people who want to work together and help each other out wherever it is possible. There are several startup events, being held almost daily in every kind of location, ranging from small cafés to outside locations or even big forums. It is not about big startups just wanting to make money, it is also about small ideas on how to improve the city’s culture, the living standard or people’s wellbeing. These vibes can be perceived wherever you go. That being said, people living in Berlin are very open-minded and interested in learning from each other while trying not to judge people on who they are. The Germans are generally very neat and polite, but it might seem as if the way Germans speak is a bit monotone or aggressive when you first talk to them. They do not want to be rude, it is just the way they speak. However, if you talk to them in English, their pronunciation can be hilariously wrong, which probably will make you laugh.","caption":"Innovative and an incentive for young people"}],"articlesV2":[{"title":"The 12 districts of Berlin: Neighbourhood guide ","description":"Explore Berlin's districts based on their quality of life, infrastructure, internationality, safety and rental prices.

Kreuzberg, for instance hosts a Turkish market, where you can buy all kinds of food, spices and everything related to the Turkish culture. It is quite common that you simply bargain the price for whatever you want to buy. Most of the time, you can save money by going to such markets. Nevertheless, it is also a cultural district where you can find the Jewish Museum, the East Side Gallery and heaps of Street Art like graffiti that covers almost the whole district. This feature imparts the whole area a very personal touch and makes it also a bit mysterious. You can walk there for hours since every street corner is different and has its own magical flair.
