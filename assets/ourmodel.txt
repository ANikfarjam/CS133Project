To be able to recommend a good city or state, we needed to classify our data. The first step of the journey was to select a good model. At the beginning stage of data collection, we were thinking about using KNearest Neighbor(KNN classification. But again since we are not defining any label, we decided to research and learn about unsupervised models. We explored K Mean Clustering vs Hierarchical Clustering.
K-Means Clustering: This algorithm partitions the data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity. It's useful for identifying distinct groups within the data.
Hierarchical Clustering: This method builds a hierarchy of clusters either by a bottom-up approach or a top-down approach. It's beneficial for understanding the data structure and identifying hierarchical relationships between clusters.
Based on the description K-Mean clustering seemed more suitable because the recommendation was based on the similarities of the cities/states. Thus I made a script to compare the performance and ran it three times: once with 15000, once with 30000, and once with about 60000 data shape, this turns out to be our result. 
As it is noticeable we can see KM outperform Hiracial specially for a bigger data set. Another advantage was, since our data was upscaled, I have to use the data set with 60k data. After training and testing modules this is the result of clustered data.
